- 👋 Hi, my real name is Safwan, Liruma is my nickname.
- 👀 I’m interested in any smart contract development on EVM-compatible chain.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my advanced Solidity coding and best practices skills using upgradeable proxy contract and multi-sig wallet. I applied my best smart contract skills on my Treehauz NFT marketplace project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to migrate from my web2 job to full time web3 professional job.
- 📫 You may contact me at lirumadev@gmail.com or message me on my Linkedin profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohd-amirul-safwan-sahalrudin-6a2119165/
